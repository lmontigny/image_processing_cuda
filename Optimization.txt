Bonus: Optimization (Optional)

    Shared Memory: Use shared memory to cache data that is accessed multiple times by threads within the same block.

    Coalesced Memory Access: Ensure that memory accesses are coalesced to minimize memory latency.

    Occupancy: Optimize the number of threads per block to maximize GPU occupancy.

    Asynchronous Transfers: Use asynchronous memory transfers to overlap computation and data transfer.
